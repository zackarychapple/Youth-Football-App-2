# Onboarding/Team Route Fixed ✅

## Issue
The `/onboarding/team` route was missing and showing a "not found" page.

## Solution
Created the onboarding/team route with a complete team creation and joining interface.

## What's Been Added

### New Route: `/onboarding/team`
- **Location:** `src/routes/onboarding/team.tsx`
- **Features:**
  - Create new team with team name and coach name
  - Join existing team with 6-character invite code
  - Success screen with invite code display
  - Copy invite code to clipboard
  - Skip option to go directly to dashboard

### User Flow
1. **New User Sign Up** → Redirects to `/onboarding/team`
2. **Team Creation:**
   - Enter team name (e.g., "Riverside Ravens")
   - Enter coach name (e.g., "Coach Smith")
   - Creates team and generates invite code
   - Shows success screen with copyable invite code
   - Continue to dashboard

3. **Join Team:**
   - Enter 6-character invite code from head coach
   - Join the team
   - Redirect to dashboard

### Auth Guard Logic
- If user is authenticated but has no team → Redirects to `/onboarding/team`
- If user has a team → Goes to dashboard
- Sign up flow now redirects to `/onboarding/team` instead of dashboard

## How to Test

1. **Create New Account:**
   - Go to http://localhost:3000
   - Click "Create Team"
   - Sign up with new email
   - You'll be redirected to `/onboarding/team`
   - Create a team or join with invite code

2. **Existing User (Coach Zack):**
   - Sign in with: `zackarychapple30+mock1@gmail.com` / `GameDay2025!`
   - If no team exists, you'll be sent to `/onboarding/team`
   - Create "Lassiter Jr. Trojans - 2nd" team
   - Get invite code to share with assistant coaches

## UI Features
- **Touch-optimized:** Large 56px input fields and buttons
- **Mobile-first:** Responsive card layout
- **Clear navigation:** Tabs for Create/Join team
- **Success feedback:** Visual confirmation with invite code
- **Clipboard support:** One-click copy for invite codes

## Technical Notes
- Currently stores team data in localStorage (temporary until database is set up)
- Generates random 6-character uppercase invite codes
- Form validation ensures all required fields
- Responsive design works on all screen sizes
- Follows the app's green color scheme

## Next Steps
Once database tables are created:
1. Replace localStorage with actual database calls
2. Implement real team creation with Supabase
3. Add player roster import after team creation
4. Validate invite codes against database

The onboarding flow is now complete and working!
