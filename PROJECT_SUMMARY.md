- **RPC functions** for complex operations
- **Idempotent operations** for offline sync
- **No complex RLS** - simple, public data model

#### Testing
- **Puppeteer** E2E test suite
- **Performance benchmarks** (play entry < 5 seconds)
- **Touch target validation** (56px minimum)
- **Offline capability tests**

### Mobile Optimizations ‚úÖ
- Touch targets 56px height for gloved hands
- Swipe gestures for common actions
- Bottom sheets for forms
- Number pad for jersey entry
- High contrast colors for outdoor visibility
- Works completely offline

### Database Schema ‚úÖ
- Teams with invite codes
- Players with positions and striped status
- Games with configurable field sizes
- Plays stored as JSONB for flexibility
- Player participation tracking
- Offline sync queue

### API Functions ‚úÖ
- `create_team_with_coach`
- `join_team_with_code`
- `bulk_create_players`
- `get_team_roster`
- `start_game`
- `record_play` (idempotent)
- `get_active_game`
- `update_game_attendance`

## üöÄ How to Run

```bash

pnpm test:e2e:auth    # Test authentication
pnpm test:e2e:roster  # Test roster management
pnpm test:e2e:game    # Test game tracking
pnpm test:e2e:mpr     # Test MPR compliance

# Build for production
pnpm build
```

## üì± Key Features for Coaches

1. **Speed**: Add 20 players in < 2 minutes
2. **Simplicity**: ONE-TAP game start
3. **Reliability**: Works completely offline

## üèÜ Mission Accomplished

The app successfully addresses the core problem: helping volunteer coaches track MPR compliance during chaotic youth football games. It works with:
- Wet, gloved hands
- Muddy sidelines
- 20-second play clocks
- Parents yelling
- Network failures

Every technical decision supports the reality of youth football, not an ideal world.
