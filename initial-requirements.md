1) A football coach can create their team
2) Coaches can add other coaches with an invite link
3) Coaches can sign in with Supabase auth
4) Coaches can add players to their team with their numbers
5) Coaches can create multiple named lineups that have a list of kids. For example starting offense, beast offense,
   starting defense
6) During a game coaches should have an easy to use interface that fits on a phone that lets them document the plays, who's in, and who needs plays still.
7) Kids have a minimum number of plays that they need, this minimum number defaults to 8 plays, but coaches can decrease that number based on multiple factors, the need to write a note when they do this. 
8) A game can be edited after it is over in case things were missed in the recording
9) Plays should be numbered and easily allow for a play to be deleted, added back, edited, or added to after the fact.
10) No information should be required on a play. 
11) For a team that has multiple people who can get the ball as quarterback the coach should be able to easily assign who's a quarterback, who's a reciever, who's a running back. All other players should be listed underneath the grouped sections just in case they get the ball. 
12) Offense play flow should be as follows, select qb, select play type (run, pass, qb keep), select outcome
13) Defense play select who (multiple people sometimes) made the tackle, also can select play type, and outcome. For example opponent qb pass to player 12, Owen (player name), made the tackle
14) Downs should be tracked and allowed to be updated at any time, same for what yard they are starting at
15) There should be a side panel that slides out that easily allows for the toggling of which players are in and out and the switching of offense and defense
16) Entire current game roster should be in the slide out. Also at the top a quick set of boxes for things like "starting offense" "starting defense" should be there that automatically toggles those children
17) When a player gets injured a coach should be able to mark the kid as injured on the play, or in the toggle, it should get marked at which play a kid was marked injured no matter where it was marked. 
18) Player stats should automatically be tracked. Plays in the game, offense yards, offense attempts, tackles, etc.
