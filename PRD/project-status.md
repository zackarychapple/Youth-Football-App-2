## 🚨 Blockers & Risks

### Current Risks
1. **⚠️ Aggressive Timeline:** 6-week MVP timeline requires exceptional coordination
2. **⚠️ Offline Complexity:** Sync architecture needs early validation
3. **⚠️ No Mobile Testing Yet:** Need real device testing by Day 3

### Identified Dependencies
- UI Engineer needs Supabase project credentials (Day 2 morning)
- Both engineers need TypeScript types from database schema (Day 2 afternoon)
- Component integration testing requires both auth and UI complete (Day 3)
