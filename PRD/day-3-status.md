## Risk Mitigation

### Identified Risks
1. **Bulk Import Parsing**
   - Multiple CSV formats
   - Mitigation: Flexible parser, preview before import

2. **Performance with 25+ Players**
   - List rendering lag
   - Mitigation: Virtual scrolling, pagination fallback

3. **Offline Play Recording**
   - Network drops during game
   - Mitigation: Queue all plays locally first

## Notes for Day 4

Based on Day 3 progress:
1. Complete any unfinished play tracking UI
2. Full offline sync implementation
3. Parent share codes
4. Real device testing
5. Performance optimization
