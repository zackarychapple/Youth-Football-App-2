   - Excellent gesture handling patterns for gloved hands
   - Smart virtual scrolling for 20+ player rosters
   - Comprehensive offline state management with Zustand

2. **Supabase Architect's Work:**
   - Brilliant simplification with public-data approach
   - JSONB for plays provides maximum flexibility
   - Materialized views solve real-time MPR calculation performance
   - Robust offline sync queue with retry logic

3. **Team Alignment:**

- **Mobile-First:** Every UI decision prioritizes thumb operation
- **Failure Handling:** Comprehensive offline queue and retry mechanisms

---

## Dependencies Status

### Critical Path Items for Day 2

1. **Morning (9 AM):**
   - Supabase Architect must complete project setup (TASK-SA-001)
   - Provide credentials to UI Engineer immediately upon completion

2. **Afternoon (2 PM):**
   - Database schema (TASK-SA-002) generates TypeScript types
   - These types needed by UI Engineer for store configuration

3. **End of Day:**
   - Auth endpoints (TASK-SA-003) must be ready for UI integration

### No Current Blockers
All dependencies are clearly understood and scheduled appropriately.

---

## Risk Assessment

### Risks Identified

1. **Offline Sync Complexity (Medium Risk)**
   - Mitigation: Starting with simple last-write-wins
   - Architect has included sync queue for resilience
   - Plan to validate with real data by Day 4

2. **Mobile Performance (Low Risk)**
   - Mitigation: Virtual scrolling already specified
   - Component specs include performance budgets
   - Will profile on real devices Day 3

3. **Timeline Pressure (Medium Risk)**
   - Mitigation: Clear daily objectives set
   - Public-data approach saves significant time
   - Core MPR features prioritized over nice-to-haves

---

## Adjustments Needed

### Minor Course Corrections

1. **TypeScript Generation:**
   - Need to ensure Supabase CLI generates types immediately after schema creation
   - Add this as explicit step in TASK-SA-002

2. **Mobile Testing:**
   - Should acquire test devices (iPhone 12, mid-range Android) by Day 3
   - Add specific device testing checkpoints

3. **Parent Access Testing:**
   - Need to validate share code mechanism works without auth
   - Add test case to Day 4 objectives
