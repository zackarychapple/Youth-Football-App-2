# Fixes Applied to Football Tracker

## ✅ Issues Fixed

### 1. Sign Out Button
- **Status:** Already exists in dashboard
- **Location:** User dropdown menu in header
- **How to use:** Click on user icon in top-right, then "Sign Out"

### 2. Routing & Default Route
- **Status:** Fixed
- **Changes Made:**
  - Homepage now redirects authenticated users to `/dashboard`
  - Added Sign In and Create Team buttons on landing page
  - Improved landing page with features and test credentials
  - Test credentials displayed: `zackarychapple30+mock1@gmail.com / GameDay2025!`

### 3. Mock Team Creation
- **Status:** Account created, team setup pending
- **What's Done:**
  - Created Coach Zack account: `zackarychapple30+mock1@gmail.com`
  - Password: `GameDay2025!`
  - User ID: `f6d77cb8-931a-43a2-91e5-3a7dbfc29da6`
  
**Note:** The team and players from `initial_team.json` cannot be created yet because the database tables don't exist in Supabase. You need to run the database migrations first.

## 📱 How to Test

1. **Visit the app:** http://localhost:3000
2. **Sign in with:**
   - Email: `zackarychapple30+mock1@gmail.com`
   - Password: `GameDay2025!`
3. **After sign in:**
   - You'll be redirected to the dashboard
   - Sign out button is in the user dropdown (top-right)

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Database Setup Required
The app's UI is built but needs the database tables to be created in Supabase:
1. Run the migrations from `/supabase/migrations/`
2. This will create teams, players, games, and other required tables
3. Then the mock team data can be imported

### Features Ready in UI
- ✅ Authentication (sign in/out working)
- ✅ Landing page with proper routing
- ✅ Dashboard layout
- ✅ Player roster management UI
- ✅ Game tracking interface
- ✅ MPR compliance dashboard
- ✅ Touch-optimized components

### Features Needing Database
- ❌ Team creation
- ❌ Player management
- ❌ Game tracking
- ❌ MPR calculations

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Confirm email** in Supabase dashboard if required
2. **Run database migrations** to create tables
3. **Run mock team script** after tables exist:
   ```bash
   pnpm tsx scripts/seed-mock-team.ts
   ```
4. **Test the full flow** with team and players
